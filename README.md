_This is a webpage where the user can input two numbers, one starting point and one ending point and click show result. When the results show base on what number they have. The rules are if the number contains a 1: all digits will be replaced with "beep". If it contains a 2: all digits are replaced with "boop". If it contains a number 3 all digits are replaced with "I'm sorry I'm afraid I can't do that"_

## Known Bugs

_If you open index.html file in google chrome and select the three little dots on the top right and open the console. When the user submits their numbers. If it's a double digit number the function ifResult is not being tracked correctly.
